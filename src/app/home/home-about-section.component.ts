My greatest passion is programming. I started by creating simple websites in html and css. Then I learned javascript and typescript, currently I create my projects in the Angular framework and 
    I spend a lot of time learning Java. 
    I created designs or graphics for my websites myself in Adobe programs because I have the title of graphic technician. 
    I already have my first experience in programming because I participated in creating a website for a certain store. I also have other projects. I have been interested in programming for over two years. I am a communicative, creative person and I like working in a team. I avoid conflicts and always look for a solution to a given problem.
     Apart from programming, I do a lot of sports such as running or long hikes. I also like reading biographies..</p>
